        <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Hello, my name is <b>Divyanshu</b>, and I recently completed this web development project where I utilized <b>Bootstrap</b>, along with <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>. <br><br>I used Bootstrap to streamline responsive design and enhance the UI components, while custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript helped me implement specific functionality and styling tailored to the project.</h3>
        <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Career counselling is essential for helping individuals make informed career choices, but many students—especially in high school—struggle due to a <b>lack of guidance</b>, limited access to resources, or external pressure.<br>
To address this, we developed a platform that offers <b>career counselling support in just a few clicks</b>, providing access to <b>expert advice</b>, career options, and personalized recommendations.<br>
A key feature is our interactive <b>career roadmap flowchart</b>, specifically designed for high school students.<br>
Whether they have a goal or are still uncertain, the flowchart presents a <b>clear step-by-step path</b> based on their <b>interests, strengths</b>, and academic background.<br>
It breaks down complex career paths into manageable stages like <b>courses, skill-building, and entrance exams</b>, helping students move from <b>confusion to clarity</b> and take confident steps toward their future.
